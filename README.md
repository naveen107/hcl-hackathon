# Hackathon Project: B2B E-commerce Platform

## Problem Statement
Businesses often face challenges in managing their supply chain and procurement processes efficiently. Existing solutions are either too generic or lack the scalability required for B2B operations. This project aims to build a robust and scalable e-commerce platform tailored specifically for B2B needs, enabling seamless vendor management, product categorization, and order tracking.

---

## Project Overview
This project is a B2B e-commerce platform designed to streamline the buying and selling process for businesses. The platform provides a robust and scalable solution for managing vendors, users, categories, products, and carts. It also includes a dashboard for users and agents to manage orders and product details efficiently.

## Technology Stack
We have chosen the following technologies to build this platform:

### Frontend
1. **React.js**
   - **Why?**: React.js is a powerful library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture ensures reusability and maintainability.
   
2. **TypeScript**
   - **Why?**: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality.

3. **Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS**
   - **Why?**: These CSS frameworks simplify the process of creating responsive and visually appealing designs. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling, while Bootstrap offers pre-designed components.

### Backend
1. **Node.js**
   - **Why?**: Node.js is a lightweight, efficient, and scalable runtime environment for building server-side applications. Its non-blocking I/O model makes it ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously, which is crucial for an e-commerce platform.

2. **TypeScript**
   - **Why?**: TypeScript ensures type safety and improves code maintainability, making it easier to manage complex backend logic.

3. **PostgreSQL**
   - **Why?**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that provides advanced features like ACID compliance, scalability, and support for complex queries. It is well-suited for managing structured data like products, categories, and user information.

4. **REST API**
   - **Why?**: REST APIs provide a standardized way to interact with the backend services. They ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend, making the platform modular and easy to integrate with other systems.

5. **Algolia**
   - **Why?**: Algolia is a fast and reliable search-as-a-service platform. It enhances the user experience by providing instant and accurate search results, which is critical for an e-commerce platform with a large product catalog.

## Modules
The platform is divided into the following modules:

### 1. **Vendor**
   - Manage vendor profiles and their associated products.

### 2. **User**
   - Handle user registration, authentication, and profile management.

### 3. **Category**
   - Organize products into categories for better navigation and searchability.

### 4. **Product**
   - Manage product details, including descriptions, prices, and inventory.

### 5. **Cart**
   - Enable users to add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.

---

## Dashboard
The platform includes a dashboard with the following functionalities:

### 1. **User Dashboard**
   - Users can log in to view their order history and track current orders.

### 2. **Agent Dashboard**
   - Agents can log in to manage categories and update product details.

---

## Scalable Architecture
The platform is designed with scalability in mind to handle increasing traffic and data as the business grows. Key architectural decisions include:
- **Microservices**: Modular services for user management, product management, and order processing.
- **Database Optimization**: PostgreSQL with indexing and optimized queries for high performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability.
- **Caching**: Using in-memory caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

## Testing
We ensure the platform's reliability and robustness through comprehensive testing:

### 1. **Unit Testing**
   - Framework: Jest
   - Focus: Testing individual modules like user authentication, product management, and cart functionality.

### 2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Framework: Playwright
   - Focus: Testing the entire user journey, including login, product search, and checkout.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with the database credentials.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Access the platform via `http://localhost:3000`.
